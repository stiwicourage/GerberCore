# Native credential-store verification

Run these checks on each supported platform after installing the published Gerber module. Use a disposable identifier such as `gerber:test:manual:<platform>` and a non-production value.

The separate native-platform CI lane runs isolated Core and Plugin API credential round trips; see [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and the feature-branch rollout. Those checks do not replace the interactive, new-session, and authenticated-command checks below.

## Common procedure

1. Install and import Gerber:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module Gerber
   Import-Module Gerber -Force
   Invoke-Gerber
   ```

2. Run `/secrets set`, enter the disposable identifier, and enter a test value at the non-echoing prompt.
3. Run `/secrets list` and confirm the identifier is listed without its value.
4. Run `/secrets test` and confirm the status is `Stored`.
5. Run `/secrets get`, confirm the clipboard/reveal prompt behavior, and verify the value.
6. Run `/secrets set` again, approve overwrite, and store a different value.
7. Start a new PowerShell session, import Gerber, and confirm `/secrets get` returns the updated value.
8. Run `/secrets remove`, then confirm `/secrets test` reports `Not stored`.
9. Configure an Azure DevOps profile, store its PAT as `gerber:ado:<profile>:pat`, and run an authenticated ADO command.
10. Remove the profile PAT and confirm the same ADO command reports the missing identifier and `/secrets set` recovery step while unrelated commands still work.

## macOS

Expected backend: Apple Keychain.

- Run the common procedure in a normal logged-in macOS user session.
- If macOS displays a Keychain security prompt, review and answer the native prompt; Gerber does not bypass it.
- Optionally confirm that Keychain Access contains an entry in the `Gerber` application namespace.

## Windows

Expected backend: Windows Credential Manager.

- Run the common procedure in PowerShell 7.4 or later under the intended Windows user account.
- Optionally inspect Windows Credential Manager after creation and after removal.
- Confirm no additional PowerShell SecretManagement or SecretStore module is required.

## Ubuntu with Secret Service

Expected backend: Secret Service through `libsecret`.

- Use a graphical user session with D-Bus and a supported Secret Service provider, such as GNOME Keyring.
- Install the distribution's `libsecret` runtime package when it is not already present.
- Run the common procedure from PowerShell 7.4 or later in that user session.

## Ubuntu without Secret Service

On a headless session or a system without D-Bus, `libsecret`, or a Secret Service provider:

1. Import Gerber and start `Invoke-Gerber`; both should work without credential initialization.
2. Run `/secrets list` or another explicit credential operation.
3. Confirm Gerber reports that native credential storage is unavailable and identifies the Linux Secret Service prerequisites.
4. Confirm Gerber does not create a plaintext credential file or fall back to configuration or environment-variable storage.
